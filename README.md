## Dependencies

- [Shared Models](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-swift) (Model, shared for both streamer and navigator)
- [Streamer](https://github.com/readium/r2-streamer-swift) (The parser/server)
- [Navigator](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-swift) (The bare ViewControllers for displaying parsed resources)
- [Readium CSS](https://github.com/readium/readium-css) (Handles styles, layout and user settings)

## Install and run the testapp

1) If you're building the `develop` branch, change the Cartfile to use `develop` for all Readium-related dependencies :

```
github "readium/r2-shared-swift" "develop"
github "readium/r2-streamer-swift" "develop"
github "readium/r2-navigator-swift" "develop"
github "readium/readium-opds-swift" "develop"
```

2) Fetch the dependencies using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) :
    * [`mkdir -p Carthage/Build/iOS`](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/3122#issuecomment-784865551)
    * `carthage update --use-xcframeworks`

3) Open the Xcode project: `open r2-testapp-swift.xcodeproj`

4) Build the project target named `r2-testapp-swift (carthage)`.

**More build and dependency information can be found in [r2-workspace-swift](https://github.com/readium/r2-workspace-swift)**

## [@Contributors] Efficient workflow for testing changes on Readium 2

The release target `r2-testapp-swift` uses the libraries and frameworks built by **Carthage**, while the debug `r2-testapp-swift-DEBUG` can be modified to use local versions of Â **r2-shared-swift**, **r2-streamer-swift** and **r2-navigator-swift** depending of which you want to modify. Doing so will allow you to see the changes directly in the testapp, without the need for a Carthage cycle.

If you want to contribute to the development, I recommend creating a Workspace which contain the 4 projects (shared, streamer, navigator and testapp), and to use local Products as dependencies of the others to shorten development time.
e.g: in your local clone of **r2-navigator-swift**, create a debug target which uses the Product of your local clone of **r2-shared-swift**. That way, when you modify and compile **r2-shared-swift**, the modifications are directly taken in your next **r2-navigator-swift** build.
